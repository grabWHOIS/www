Is there an API to grab Whois data based off of a given filter for geographical location?

> I am working on a project and have the need to basically get Whois data for domains that do not have a home or index.html file (this part isn’t as important) but mostly based off of a specific geographical location.
> 
> For example, I want to hit an API and ask for it to return to me “all public Whois data for New York City”. The city is arbitrary in this example.
> 
> Is there an API I can hit for this? If not, could anyone recommend me some steps to take to accomplish this with some scripting in Python or Ruby?
